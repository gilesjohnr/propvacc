\title{Calculate vaccine doses received with routine vaccination and SIA campaign}
\usage{
calc_doses_SIA(v1, v2, v3 = NULL, S)
}
\arguments{
\item{v1}{a scalar giving the proportion vaccinated with first routine immunization}

\item{v2}{a scalar giving the proportion vaccinated with second routine immunization}

\item{v3}{a scalar giving the proportion vaccinated with third routine immunization (default = NULL)}

\item{S}{a scalar giving the proportion vaccinated with supplemental campaign}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the relative proportions of the population that have recieved 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 doses
}
\description{
This function calculates the proportion immune by calculating the conditional probability of routine
vaccination with two- or three-dose routine coverage and one SIA campaign. The method
assumes that vaccination events are dependent, where individuals that have recieved the first
dose are the most likely to recieve the second dose and those that have received both the first
and second doses are the most likely to receive the third. Receipt of a dose through the SIA campaign
is dependent upon vaccination with at least one dose prior to the SIA campaign.
}
\details{
When \code{v3 = NULL}, the function uses the simpler two dose method.

\examples{
calc_doses_SIA(v1=0.9, v2=0.8, S=0.97) # High coverage two-dose routine and campaign

calc_doses_SIA(v1=0.9, v2=0.85, v3=0.8, S=0.95) # High coverage two-dose routine and campaign

calc_doses_SIA(v1=0.5, v2=0.5, v3=0.5, S=0.95) # Low routine coverage and high campaign

# Boundary conditions
calc_doses_SIA(v1=1, v2=1, v3=1, S=1)
calc_doses_SIA(v1=1, v2=0, v3=0, S=0)

# Complex models reduce to simpler models
calc_doses_SIA(v1=0.9, v2=0.8, v3=0.7, S=0)
calc_doses(v1=0.9, v2=0.8, v3=0.7)

calc_doses_SIA(v1=0.9, v2=0, v3=0, S=0)
calc_doses(v1=0.9, v2=0, v3=0)
calc_doses(v1=0.9, v2=0)
